  <p>Food insecurity is a problem of limited access to safe and healthy food, on the other hand food security is when everyone has physical, social, and economic access</p>
  <p>to safe and nutritious food that meets dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. Food insecurity can be understood as the uncertainty</p> 
  <p>about access to sufficient food. There are many levels to food insecurity; for example extreme conditions of hunger among children because they do not have enough</p>
  <p>to eat. The experience of food insecurity has been found to be more severe in low-income communities in India, and for those who already experience poor health.</p> 
  <p>While factors contributing to poverty are important when considering food insecurity, it is not the only determinant. Other influences include policy, the</p>
  <p>distribution of food across populations, countries, and regions, unstable political conditions, and climate change induced adverse environmental conditions</p> 
  <p>including severe droughts, lack of water, and soil degradation and erosion. The following information will give data on the food shortages currently existing.</p>
