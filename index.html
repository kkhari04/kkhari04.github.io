  <details><summary>FOOD DISTRIBUTION</summary>
  <p style="background-color:LightGray;">Food insecurity is a problem of limited access to safe and healthy food, on the other hand food security is when everyone has physical, social, and economic access</p>
  <p style="background-color:LightGray;">to safe and nutritious food that meets dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. Food insecurity can be understood as the uncertainty</p> 
  <p style="background-color:LightGray;">about access to sufficient food. There are many levels to food insecurity; for example extreme conditions of hunger among children because they do not have enough</p>
  <p style="background-color:LightGray;">to eat. The experience of food insecurity has been found to be more severe in low-income communities in India, and for those who already experience poor health.</p> 
  <p style="background-color:LightGray;">While factors contributing to poverty are important when considering food insecurity, it is not the only determinant. Other influences include policy, the</p>
  <p style="background-color:LightGray;">distribution of food across populations, countries, and regions, unstable political conditions, and climate change induced adverse environmental conditions</p> 
  <p style="background-color:LightGray;">including severe droughts, lack of water, and soil degradation and erosion. The following information will give data on the food shortages currently existing.</p>

<details><summary>WATER DISTRIBUTION</summary>
  <p style="background-color:LightGray;">India is one of the most populous countries in the world, which supports about 17.1% of world’s population and about 20% of world’s livestock population.</p> 
  <p style="background-color:LightGray;">Booming economics, population growth and rapid urbanization have considerable impact on India’s water demand. Changes in the food consumption, lifestyle and</p>
  <p style="background-color:LightGray;">landuse pattern also play a major role in water requirement. Although India receives plenty of water as rainfall during monsoon, due to lackof storage only a small</p> 
  <p style="background-color:LightGray;">percentage of that water is actually added to the reserve. In a country like India where there is significant mismatch of spatial distribution of available water</p>
  <p style="background-color:LightGray;">with the population, the situation becomes alarming; ironically less water is available where more people live. While, as per the international norms, countries</p>
  <p style="background-color:LightGray;">with per-capita water availability less than 449092.5 gallons per year is categorized as water stressed, with per capita available water of 408145.8 gallons,</p>
  <p style="background-color:LightGray;">India is definitely a water stressed country. Studies shows that the projected per capita water availability will become 370105 gallons and 314628.9 gallons by</p>
  <p style="background-color:LightGray;">2025 and 2050 respectively and eventually India is likely to become a water scarce country. The following information will give data on the current water shortages.</p>
